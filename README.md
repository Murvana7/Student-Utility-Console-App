#  Student Utility Console App

A **menu-based console application** built as part of my early Computer Science learning journey.  
This project combines several small utilities into one program to practice **programming fundamentals** and structured problem-solving.

## Project Overview

The Student Utility Console App provides a simple text-based menu that allows users to access multiple tools commonly practiced in beginner programming courses.

The main goal of this project was to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **functions**
- Practice **loops and conditionals**
- Learn **input validation**
- Write clean and readable console output

##  Features

The application includes the following utilities:

1. **Calculator**
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations
2. **Prime Number Checker**
   - Determines whether a number is prime
3. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Checks if a number or string reads the same forwards and backwards
4. **Minimum / Maximum Finder**
   - Finds the smallest and largest values in a set of inputs
5. **Grade Average Calculator**
   - Computes the average of entered grades

Each feature is implemented as a **separate function** to keep the code modular and easy to understand.

## Technologies Used

- **C** – core implementation
- **Standard input/output (CLI)**
